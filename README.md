# GoodTube - Adblock for Youtube and more!
**Hello and welcome to GoodTube, an effective Youtube adblocker that simply works.**

If you've had trouble with your other adblockers being detected by Youtube and are looking for something more reliable - then this extension is for you.

GoodTube uses a unique, undetectable method to remove ads from Youtube. This means it will continue to work even when other adblockers such as uBlock Origin, Ghostery, Adblock Plus, etc are not working.

It can also remove all Youtube shorts, restore the old video player / ui and customise Youtube in many different ways!

## ⭐ Get it from the Chrome Web Store (for most browsers):

## ⚡️ How is this adblocker different?

Normal adblockers use "filter lists" to identify and remove ads. Unfortunately this is not very reliable. Youtube keeps changing how their ads "look" and the filters must be constantly updated. They are also very easy to detect. You've probably had some issues with them being detected or not working over the last year or two.

GoodTube takes a different approach. It uses a unique method to block ads via the "front end", which cannot be detected or stopped by Youtube.

## 💎 How much does it cost?
This extension gives you a 7 day free trial. After that it costs $2, once only, for unlimited life time access on as many devices as you like.

*If you cannot afford this due to your financial or political situation, please send an email to goodtube4u@gmail.com to request free access! :)*

## 🎉 UPDATE (13th Dec, 2025) - GoodTube becomes an official browser extension!!

Well - it's now been around one year since GoodTube was first released. What started out as a small personal project quickly gained popularity and has now grown to being used by almost 200,000 people from all over the world!

I would like to say a huge THANK YOU to everyone who has been a part of this project so far. Your support really means a lot to me and I hope everyone is enjoying using GoodTube.

Over the last few months, I've been working hard on turning this into an official browser extension. This has not been an easy task...I've spent a lot of late nights coding, trying different things until, finally, everything came together.

⭐ *I'm very happy to announce that the official GoodTube Browser Extension has now been released!!* ⭐


#### Additional information -

**1. Support for the old version of GoodTube will end Jan 1st, 2026**

Please change over to using the official extension before support ends. Don't forget to remove the old Tampermonkey version once you've swapped over.

**2. Does the extension remove the settings menu icon?**

Yes it does! Making this an extension allows me to use a normal extension menu (hidden until you click on it at the top of your browser).

With the older version, unfortunately I have no other way to provide a settings menu. Sorry it's been so annoying having it down the bottom all the time!


**3. What are the new features?**

New features:
- Automatically set video quality (highest, lowest or pick one)
- Remove "who's still listening in 2025" style comments (optional)
- Support for transcripts / chapters on the right-hand side of the video player
- Much faster loading speed (no more lag, far less bandwidth usage)
- Improved privacy and security
- Playlists properly supported in Firefox (no skipping, etc)
- Youtube Music is now supported

Upcoming new features:
- Always start in theater mode
- Remove all AI related stuff
- Fixed shuffle and loop functionality for playlists
- And more over time

**4. Does the extension cost anything?**

The extension gives you a 7 day free trial. After that it costs $2, once only, for unlimited life time access on as many devices as you like.

Please note that the existing free version is NOT being removed. You are welcome to continue to use it for as long as you like. Just remember that it is no longer being supported or updated.

The decision to make this a paid extension has not come easily and I've tried to make it as cheap as possible. The priority remains keeping this adblocker available to everyone.

With that in mind, I will give you free unlimited access:
- If you cannot afford this due to your financial or political situation.
- If you're one of the amazing people who donated to this project previously (THANK YOU so much for your support!!)

Please send an email to goodtube4u@gmail.com to request free access.

I hope you all enjoy the new extension!!! ❤️

## Legacy support: How to install the OLD version (no longer supported)
**1. Install Tampermonkey**<br>
Use this link to install for all browsers except Firefox<br>
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo<br><br>
Use this link to install for Firefox<br>
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/
<br><br>
**2. Change browser settings (you can skip this if you're using Firefox)**<br>
Click the extensions icon up the top of your browser (the little puzzle piece icon), then click `Manage extensions`.<br><br>
At the very top of the page, there's an option called `Developer mode`. You need to turn this on.<br><br>
Now scroll down and click `Details` next to the Tampermonkey extension. Then scroll down until you find the `Allow user scripts` option. You need to turn this on.
<br><br>
**3. Install GoodTube**<br>
Visit this link and press `Install` on the page that opens up:<br>
https://github.com/goodtube4u/goodtube/raw/refs/heads/main/goodtube.user.js
<br><br>
**4. Restart your browser**
<br><br>
**5. Turn off any other adblockers you're using on Youtube**<br>
You can leave your adlockers on for other websites, they just need to be turned off for Youtube. This is because they often trigger Youtube's adblock detection and this can cause issues.
<br><br>
**6. That's it, you're good to go! Enjoy :)**
