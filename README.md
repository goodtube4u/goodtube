# GoodTube - Free Youtube Adblocker
**Hello and welcome to GoodTube, a free adblocker for Youtube.**

This solution works in all browsers, including Google Chrome.

It uses an alternative method to remove ads, which means it will continue to work even when other conventional adblockers such as uBlock Origin, AdGuard, Ghostery, Brave Browser, etc aren't working.

It also provides a few additional options:
- Remove all shorts from Youtube (enabled by default)
- Hide info cards from videos
- Hide end screen suggested videos
- Hide sidebar suggested videos
- Hide comments
- Hide AI summaries
- Always play videos from the start

*These can be accessed via the custom settings menu. You will find this down the bottom right of Youtube when installed.*

## How to install
**1. Install Tampermonkey**<br>
Use this link to install for all browsers except Firefox<br>
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo<br><br>
Use this link to install for Firefox<br>
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/
<br><br>
**2. Change browser settings (you can skip this if you're using Firefox)**<br>
Click the extensions icon up the top of your browser (the little puzzle piece icon), then click `Manage extensions`.<br><br>
At the very top of the page, there's an option called `Developer mode`. You need to turn this on.<br><br>
Now scroll down and click `Details` next to the Tampermonkey extension. Then scroll down until you find the `Allow user scripts` option. You need to turn this on.
<br><br>
**3. Install GoodTube**<br>
Visit this link and press `Install` on the page that opens up:<br>
https://github.com/goodtube4u/goodtube/raw/refs/heads/main/goodtube.user.js
<br><br>
**4. Restart your browser**
<br><br>
**5. Turn off any other adblockers you're using on Youtube**<br>
You can leave your adlockers on for other websites, they just need to be turned off for Youtube. This is because they often trigger Youtube's adblock detection and this can cause issues.
<br><br>
**6. That's it, you're good to go! Enjoy :)**
<br><br>
*This install process sounds more difficult than it is. If you're not technical you can do it!! Simply follow the steps as they're written and in a few minutes you'll have it working <3*


## FAQs
**Do I need to update this?**<br>
Nope, updates are pushed to you automatically so you don't have to do anything to use the latest version.

**Playlists skip to the next video every few seconds**<br>
This is usually caused by another adblocker which Youtube is detecting. To fix this problem, first disable all of your other adblockers (for Youtube only, you can leave them on for other websites). Then clear your cookies and cache (this is important). Once that's done, refresh Youtube and the problem should be fixed.

**I can't use the miniplayer**<br>
The Youtube miniplayer is not supported. Instead this uses "Picture in Picture" mode, which is the new standard for the web. Unfortunately Firefox does not support the Picture in Picture API, so the button is disabled in Firefox until they decide to include this feature.

**Is this compatible with other Youtube extensions?**<br>
Short answer - probably not. This heavily modifies how Youtube works in order to block ads. A key part of this is replacing the default Youtube player with their "embedded" player. This means that unless your extension also works for embedded Youtube videos (like where you view a Youtube video on another website), it generally won't be compatible. Unfortunately there's not much I can do to support these extensions as a result. Honestly though - you probably never needed them anyway, just play the video and be happy.

**I'm having a different problem**<br>
If you're having a different issue, most of the time you will find it's caused by a conflicting extension you have installed. The first thing to do is turn off all other extensions you have installed. Leave only Tampermonkey and GoodTube enabled. Then refresh Youtube, check if the problem is fixed. If it is, then you know one of them is causing the issue. Turn your other extensions back on back on one at a time until you find the problem.


## Why is removing these ads so important?
Youtube is currently the _largest online archive of music, art and educational videos in the world_.<br>

The importance of allowing people to access these things for free cannot be overstated.<br>

Youtube also contains rare and extremely important digitised versions of physical media such as records, films, etc - which can be accessed nowhere else. It is extremely important that we preserve this content for future generations.<br>

This content is for _everyone_ and is not Youtube's to sell back to us. They did not create it, nor do they own it.<br>

Initially Youtube was completely free, which is why so much content was uploaded there in the first place. But in recent years, more and more commercial ads are being pushed on users. This is disgraceful.<br>

I see Youtube in the same capacity as a library or museam and as such hold them to the same standards. They have a social repsonsibility which is not being taken seriously. I do not care what their terms of service say at all.<br>

Many people cannot afford to buy premium. A large portion of the world lives in extreme poverty, even in first world countries. Many people have mental health conditions which are simply not conducive to buying premium. These are just a few examples.<br>

This timeless human content belongs to everyone, not just the wealthy and privileged. It should not be disrespected with more and more commercial ads in this way.<br>

As a human being on this earth, with a heart, soul, mind and spirit - you matter and are important. You are not simply a product to be bought and sold by capitalist companies such as Youtube.<br>

This plugins helps to keep this important resource free and available to everyone.
